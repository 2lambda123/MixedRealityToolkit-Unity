# Getting Started

![MRTK Logo](../Documentation/Images/MRTK_Logo_Rev.png)

The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a cross-platform toolkit for building Mixed Reality experiences for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development, we recommend you start at the beginning of our [Unity development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/unity-development-overview?tabs=mrtk%2Chl2). 

The Unity development journey is the **recommended starting point for MRTK**, specifically created to walk you through the installation, core concepts, and usage of MRTK in Unity. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The Unity development journey currently uses **MRTK version 2.4.0** and **Unity 2019.3.15**. If you're working with other configurations it's still recommended that you start there, but you can also refer to the [installation instructions](Installation.md).
