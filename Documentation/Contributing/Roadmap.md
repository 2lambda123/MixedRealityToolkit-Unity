**User Experience**

We're listening to your feedback about MRTK and have continued plans for:
- Bug fixes
- Making MRTK UX controls easier to understand
- HoloLens Shell parity
- Tests to ensure features do not regress

**Platform Expansion**

The MRTK team is happy to support the open future of mixed reality. Support for OpenXR is currently under development and will be available alongside Unity's OpenXR preview package.

**Developer Education**

[Developer documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and example scenes are an ongoing priority for the MRTK team. 

With continued investments in [MRTK tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/tutorials), the MRTK team seeks to accelerate the getting started experience for developers and improve instructions on how to leverage Azure Services and other extensions with the MRTK.

 **Packaging**

The MRTK currently supports Unity Package Manager (UPM). We want to make it even easier for you to download packages with UPM as we make improvements and respond to your feedback.
