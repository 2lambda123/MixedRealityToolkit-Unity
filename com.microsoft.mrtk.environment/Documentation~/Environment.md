# Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit Environment

The environment package contains features that enable developers to easly work with spatial awareness and virtual reality boundaries. 

>![NOTE]
>The environment package is in early preview and does not contain all of the planned features. The existing features
>may undergo major, breaking architectural changes before release.

## Boundary subsystem

The boundary subsystem centralizes data from the Unity XR subsystems to simplify the steps required to access boundary data.

>![NOTE]
>The boundary subsystem is an early implementation for which we are requesting feedback. If the community determines it is not useful, it may be removed in a future preview release.

## Spatial awareness visualizations

In a future preview release, components will be added that enable visually compelling and easy to use visualizations of spatial awareness data (ex: meshes).
